<!-- 
Document type definition for the SSO environment simulator's configuration file.
-->

<!-- 
Required element to indicate what ports the proxy and console should be located.
An option attribute allow-non-sso-traffic indicates whether the proxy port should
support forward proxying of any URLs that do not match any of the configured
sso-traffic values. This attribute defaults to false meaning that forward 
proxying is not supported.
-->

<!ATTLIST config proxy-port CDATA #REQUIRED >

<!-- 
console-recording element is used to turn on/off recording of sso and rest api
traffic that shows in the the SSO Traffic tab and Rest Traffic tabs respectively
in the simulator's console. Should be 'true' or 'false'. If not included then
the default is false for both values.
-->

<!-- 
sso-cookie element is required and indicates the namd and domain of the cookie 
that will be set by the simulator's sign-in pages if used and will be looked for
by its agent when enforcing access to URLs.

<!ELEMENT sso-cookie EMPTY >
<!ATTLIST sso-cookie domain CDATA #REQUIRED >
<!ATTLIST sso-cookie name CDATA #REQUIRED >

<!--
The sso-sign-in-url is required and its value attribute must be the full URL to 
a sign-in page that will allow a user of the simulator to sign in and have a 
proper cookie set that will be honored by the simulator's agent implementation 
when enforcing access to URLs. Two pages are available from the simulator:
http://<host>:<console-port>/admin/selectUser.jsp
http://<host>:<console-port>/admin/simpleSelectUser.jsp
-->
<!ELEMENT sso-sign-in-url EMPTY >
<!ATTLIST sso-sign-in-url value CDATA #REQUIRED >

<!-- 
Options elements used to inject custom headers for all SSO traffic. One such 
typical value is 'policy-service-url' which tells the SSO client library and
other applications where the policy server's REST api resides. The simulator
implements that api at:
http://<host>:<console-port>/rest/
-->
<!ELEMENT sso-header EMPTY >
<!ATTLIST sso-header name CDATA #REQUIRED >
<!ATTLIST sso-header value CDATA #REQUIRED >

<!-- 
Required element whose nested elements define what traffic hitting the proxy-port
should be considered SSO traffic and subject to header injection and URL 
enforcement. Supports non http URLs used for fine grained permissions.

<!-- 
Directive that tells the simulator to rewrite the location header on any response
where the location header's value starts with the value of the from attribute and
that prefix will be replaced by the value of the to attribute. 

WARNING: ensure that your application will have a similar functionality in its
ultimate deployment environment. For example, java applications are fronted with
IHS a variant of apache web server and hence can mimic this with proxyPassReverse.
Mark Logic apps have no such reverse proxy fronting them. Alternatively, if 
designed correctly applications should be congnizant of the canonical context at
which they are deployed by virtue of the cctx header and redirect appropriately.
